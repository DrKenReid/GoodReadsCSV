I think about 40% of the text is descriptions of drinks drank by the various alcoholic characters.<br/><br/>So -- this book is a 'product of it's time', and therefore considers being Jewish to be a socially disgraceful trait; being black to mean, well, let's just say Hemingway didn't show basic humanity at the only mention of black people in this novel - and women are generally only considered by their beauty - and so on.<br/><br/>I listened to the audiobook, and William Hurt had a fantastic voice, which I think made me enjoy this book more than I should have. The story is deeply dull - and as I said in my introductory statement, it is interspersed somewhere between descriptions of alcohol - kind of. Not that I'm at all sure what the actual plot is - this feels almost like a character study. That's impossible, of course, as the characters have no depth, but bull fighting is described with near-romantic interest, if that's your thing. <br/><br/>Admittedly, Brett does have a smidgen of depth with the history of domestic violence, hence her alcoholism, and it is somewhat implied that the men are alcoholics due to being in the war. If you accidentally skipped the few sentences where these deeply salient plot points were mentioned (again, somewhere between the Pernod, Martinis and wine), I forgive you.<br/><br/>I'm not sure why this book is so critically acclaimed as Hemingway's best - it feels like he is simply describing a depressed pick me alcoholic whose only character trait is finding a new partner every few days while a group of men swoon and fight over her.<br/><br/>Frankly, if this was written by anyone else, I doubt people would have read past the first chapter. But it's Hemingway, so it must be a masterpiece, and the bad writing must in fact be layers of such depth that we're just not smart enough to dig into it. That was sarcasm, and this review has now provided more interesting writing devices than in the entirety of The Sun Also Rises. Now I'm going to go and get real 'tight'.",,,1,0,"2023-05-16,2023-05-19",Classics|10436;Fiction|6731;Classic|1476;Literature|1196,451924

The author's prose is strikingly vivid and richly detailed, creating a rich and immersive reading experience. <br/><br/>Despite the writing being great throughout, the story falls short in book 3 in comparison to the previous 2. While the narrative is ambitious and complex, the special and fascinating events become the norm and less exciting. The characters feel somewhat retconned in their personalities and lack emotional depth, making it challenging for the reader to connect with them.<br/><br/>This was still an enjoyable read. The writing in Death's End is a testament to Cixin's talent and serves as a testament to his enduring legacy as one of the most talented writers of science fiction in recent memory. While the story may be lackluster, the sheer quality of Cixin's writing is enough to make Death's End a worthwhile read.

From the first page to the last, I found myself bored and disinterested in the story and its characters.<br/><br/>Holden Caulfield, the protagonist of the book, is an annoying and whiny teenager who complains about everything and everyone around him. He spends the entire novel wandering around New York City, getting into pointless arguments with strangers, and complaining about how 'phony' everyone is. I found him to be insufferable and the word 'phony' is permanently tainted by how I imagine Holden's voice to sound - insufferable.<br/><br/>The writing style of Salinger is important for the development of literature, I don't argue that. However, the stream-of-consciousness narrative feels disjointed and rambling, with no real plot or direction. It's as if Salinger wrote the book without any real purpose or message. The characters are unlikable, the plot is non-existent, and the writing is tedious and unengaging.<br/><br/>If you are looking for an engaging and thought-provoking read, ""The Catcher in the Rye"" is not the book for you.

Through a carefully crafted narrative that spans centuries and galaxies, Liu explores the intricacies of astrophysics, cognitive science, and sociology, providing readers with a glimpse into the intricacies of the universe and the complexities of human nature.<br/><br/>There is seamless integration of scientific concepts into the plot, making this a compelling read for anyone interested in the natural sciences. Liu's deep understanding of physics and astronomy is evident throughout the novel, from the portrayal of the ""droplet"" spaceship's complex propulsion system to the detailed explanations of the gravitational waves generated by black hole mergers. The skillful use of scientific concepts in the novel's central conflict between humanity and the enigmatic Trisolarans offers a thought-provoking exploration of the possibilities and limitations of interstellar communication.<br/><br/>The true genius of The Dark Forest lies in its ability to weave scientific speculation into a narrative that is simultaneously gripping and emotionally resonant. Liu's exploration of the ""dark forest"" theory of interstellar communication, which postulates that civilizations in the universe must remain hidden from one another to avoid mutual destruction, is a testament to his imaginative prowess. The nuanced portrayal of the human psyche in the face of an existential threat is a masterful meditation on the nature of fear, hope, and the will to survive.",,,1,0,"2023-02-23,2023-03-05",Sci Fi|3752;Science Fiction|3628;Fiction|2071;Scifi|911,163294

Walls' ability to create believable and flawed characters is truly exceptional; she crafts individuals that readers can simultaneously love and hate.<br/><br/>Walls paints a vivid picture of her unconventional (to say the least) upbringing and her family's struggles to make ends meet. Despite her parents' irresponsible behavior and their inability to provide a stable home life, Walls manages to convey their humanity in a way that elicits sympathy and understanding from readers, while simultaneously invoking a hatred that parents can be so narcissistic - and blind to the basic needs of their children.<br/><br/>One of the most remarkable aspects of The Glass Castle is the depth of character development that Walls achieves. Her portrayal of her father, in particular, is both heartbreaking and frustrating, as readers are forced to confront the reality of his addiction and his refusal to take responsibility for his actions. Yet, even in his darkest moments, Walls finds a way to show the complexity of his personality, making it difficult for readers to write him off completely.<br/><br/>Similarly, Walls' portrayal of her mother is nuanced and multifaceted. Despite her obvious flaws, readers are able to see her love for her children and her attempts to provide them with a sense of wonder and creativity. Walls does not shy away from showing the destructive aspects of her mother's behavior, but she also highlights her positive qualities in a way that humanizes her and makes her relatable (the chocolate bar scene in particular - who doesn't occasionally want to steal away and eat some chocolate - how understandable! - though not when your children are starving next to you).<br/><br/>This memoir is powerful and moving, it is moreish and resonates with readers, even those without the squalorous upbringing Walls' experienced. Her ability to create complex and believable characters is a testament to her skill as a writer, and her ability to elicit empathy from her audience is a testament to her humanity.",,,1,0,"2023-02-21,2023-02-23",Non Fiction|8509;Memoir|7913;Nonfiction|4527;Book Club|3968;Memoirs|3379;Biography|2183;Books I Own|1703;Fiction|1407;Biography Memoir|971;Autobiography|863,1238142

At first, the story appears takes place in a dystopian world where civilization is on the brink of collapse due to constant natural disasters known as ""Seasons."" The society in this world is divided and oppressed, with a ruling class known as ""Orogenes"" who possess the power to control the earth's movements, but are treated as outcasts and enslaved. However, we eventually learn that the nearing apocalypse is caused, at least inadvertently, by the deeply unethical actions of the oppressors.<br/><br/>The author tackles themes such as oppression, inequality, and class division masterfully through the perspectives of three different female characters, each of whom are navigating their own struggles in this brutal world. The novel's focus on a feminine perspective is particularly noteworthy, as it adds a refreshing layer of depth and nuance to the exploration of these themes. The characters are complex and fully realized, making it easy for readers to connect with and understand their struggles. <br/><br/>Jemisin's writing is evocative and atmospheric, immersing readers in the world of the ""Fifth Season"" and making it easy to become emotionally invested in the story. The plot is expertly crafted, with twists and turns that keep the readers on the edge of their seats.<br/><br/>""The Fifth Season"" is a thought-provoking and emotionally charged novel that is both unique and powerful in its exploration of societal issues in a unique fantasy setting. <br/><br/>Trigger warning, however, as there are rare but graphic depictions of sexual assault and violence.

An enjoyable read, with many prominent female characters of import. I am a little disappointed that the only culturally different people in the book are being cast as the enemy. <br/><br/>Mental health was an important theme in this book, surprisingly, and the characters had to face their demons (physically as well as metaphorically). Stoically getting on with life after turmoil is a common challenge amongst the main characters. <br/><br/>I must give this book a TW as there is a rather traumatic rape scene, which was unnecessary, but part of the character's arc of who is more evil: men or demons?

It's important for kids to understand their bodies and their feelings (I know I first experienced sexual desires very young - at 7 - long before standard sex ed was taught in my country - 11). Sadly, we live in a world where kids are often exploited and abused by their elders. Equipping them with knowledge of respect, boundaries, consent, etc., provides a last resort bulwark in childhood as well as a foundation for adult life. It will also allow them to feel like they can ask questions to their parents, and let their guardians know if anyone has made them feel uncomfortable or broken boundaries. This kind of education is a powerful defence against grooming and should not be shied away from. We live in a scary world. Let's equip our children with the knowledge to defend against it.<br/><br/>Next, the God stuff. I've also read the Bible, and I'm sorry but it most certainly is homophobic. You said it yourself in your book Karamo: you read the Bible looking for and with the perspective of love. You didn't read it objectively, you cherry picked, which is exactly what you were preaching against. I'm not saying Christians are all homophobic, I'm saying the source text is. Please, be Christian and love much of the Bible, but there's nothing wrong with saying that some of it is problematic, and considering the number of times it's been translated, rewritten, modified, had bits added / removed, had a sequal that many dislike, and a prequel others dislike, it's impossible for it to be perfect - if it was, there would only be a single Christian religion!<br/><br/>I learned much about colorism from you, and I appreciate that. Being Scottish I barely knew any black people till my adult life and I only recently moved to the USA, so I am still ignorant about much of these issues. Thank you for taking the time to explain this.<br/><br/>I think Karamo speaks from a place of love and kindness, but often considers his own experiences to be applicable to everyone, and forms opinions in that respect.",,,1,0,",2022-01-01",Non Fiction|243;Nonfiction|186;Memoir|183;Audiobooks|101;Lgbtq|99;Lgbt|76;Memoirs|73;Biography|70;Audio|47;Autobiography|36;Biography Memoir|36;Lgbtqia|34;Biographies|27;Queer|26;Self Help|25,7813

I'm certain that just last week I would have reacted defensively to being called racist, or even being told I said something problematic. I would have cried about how I am so very liberal, how I support BLM, etc., but I wouldn't have once tried to listen to the person trying to politely tell me that I said something offensive or upsetting.<br/><br/>I read, and was told by some, that this book goes ""SJW levels"" of liberalism. I admit I was wary going in - but that helped me pay careful attention to every word in this book. That only helped me accept the facts told.<br/><br/>I agree entirely with all the presented information in this book - though I think this book would only be read by people already willing to learn about racism. It doesn't reach the vast majority of people. So, I hope that us who read it, can instead become paragons of anti-white-fragility, provide examples of how to be open-minded to criticism and feedback from anyone about race. <br/><br/>If you are unsure about reading this book because you think it will be crackpot and ""too woke"", give it a shot and give it a thoroughly critical perusal.

I have only one criticism: many of the dishes described by the author are completely alien to me. Sharing stories of problems found in top French and Japanese restaurants, creating recipes I haven't tasted, smelled or even heard of do not aid in helping me with the basic and important elements in cooking. <br/><br/>That's a small criticism however - I learned much from this book. I had no idea about the benefits salting earlier in the cooking process (for so many foods but not all) vs later. I had a poor understanding of the Maillard reaction. I never really considered acid being such an important element, and really only considered vinegar, citrus and sour candies as acidic. Never before did I realize that salt was *so much more important* than other spices - I just assumed it was one of many, and was particularly favored in the small number of cultural foods I've explored. Turns out it's a key component in seemingly all countries and cultures.  <br/><br/>As a non-meat eater, much of the content wasn't aimed at me, but I still found it interesting as an intellectual exercise on the physics of food science (applying heat, acids, etc.).<br/><br/>Well worth the read, especially with the short page count.

Never has the ""n word"" been voiced in mind so frequently as when reading this book, which is a cringe-inducing experience. But; I was surprised by Huckleberry Finn's ability to see his traveling companion as first a lesser being, but then in time as a friend and companion, and often considering how kind and intelligent the man is. I think, in the time written, this kind of character development may have resonated within the minds of people with societally-trained racist viewpoints and made them reconsider. At least, I hope it did. <br/><br/>I found myself laughing at ridiculous scenes and gullible youthful experiences of the protagonist, when I was expecting something more somber. <br/><br/>A strange consideration: when reading the speech of the slaves in this book, which is written in a (again, incredibly racist to modern standards) phonetic manner, I couldn't help but compare it to my childhood reading poetry and stories in Scots - because I found myself having to mentally voice the words as written to make sense of them - though obviously these were entirely different phonetically sounding words and tones, and entirely different contexts. Just an odd observation.<br/><br/>I grew to really enjoy Jim's character - such a sweet man, frequently weeping when he thinks he's lost Huck to his crazy adventures, and often thinking of his family back home. An overly trusting individual who lost his only fortune to the swindling church which was too happy to take his winnings. <br/><br/>Huckleberry Finn's gullible nature rubbed on me a little, and I was most glad when he realized that King and Duke were, infact, not a King nor a Duke. Then he goes and believes several of their on-the-spot synthetic tales of past deeds! A little infuriating but that is intended I'm sure - he's young and gullible, though surprisingly educated in the history of monarchies. <br/><br/>This is a good read - I wouldn't suggest it is a *must* read (like other classic American literature such as To Kill a Mockingbird which I recently reviewed).

While not quite as impactful as Sabriel, Lirael explores the old kingdom, the magic system, the ancient bloodlines and the creation of the world (or at least the old kingdom), through the characters Lirael, Sam, D.R. Dog and Mogget. <br/><br/>I previously gave this book a 4 star rating. While I enjoyed Lirael less than Sabriel: it is still an excellent read. The strong female lead (Lirael) is struggling with the meaning of her life - even nearly attempting suicide in the depths of her depression. A destiny is thrust upon her that she did not choose but she steps up to through a feeling of the threads of fate and realization that she won't merely be taking a new responsibility, but also a family. In a parallel and eventually coinciding story, Prince Sameth embarks on an adventure to save his school-friend, Nick, from the powers native to his kingdom. One character is attempting to embrace a role they do not want, while the other desperately clings for membership to a bloodline she will never be a true part of.<br/><br/>Lirael also successfully represents the struggles of a growing woman (from my limited viewpoint) avoiding the unwanted advances of male suitors. This is a difficult topic to approach, but Nix does so expertly - surprisingly. I personally would have assumed the author to be female to have such insights, but I am a man, so check reviews by women to see if I'm anywhere near correct.<br/><br/>Writing a sequel set decades after the original novel is difficult. Characters will have developed and matured, which needs to be shown, as well as the land and political climate etc., and the author did this expertly. The originally unsure Sabriel and guilt-ridden Touchstone have grown into defenders of the realm and true royal leaders.<br/><br/>Thanks for another excellent read, Garth Nix.

I wish the author did the same with this book.<br/><br/>-Every character, other than the major plot twists, are two dimensional. For example, I know nothing about Ezekiel, except for the fact that he is pretty and his main story line. Does he have emotions, other than those required by his role as romantic interest?<br/>-All of the plot, in it's entirety, is either invokes <i>extreme emotions</i> in the characters or humor. There is no in-between.<br/>-Not all, but approximately 75% of all major plot points were predictable. <br/>-The vast majority of dialogues are generic idioms and phrases, and author attempts to make up for this by introducing unique slang. The slang, however, feels forced and cringe-inducing.<br/>-The violent moments with rockets and explosions seem to glance off the plot armor of all MCs, unless it makes a useful plot device.<br/>-The main character is 1) extremely intelligent, 2) (un)naturally gifted fighter, 3) an engineering whiz, 4) a crack shot with a rifle, 5) extremely sociable so that humans and robots either fall in love with her or will die to protect her. A flaw or two would be nice. It was nice to see she wasn't gifted with some strange mutation (which was a cool fantasy element, by the way), but then she is also a freakin' lifelike at the end.<br/>-The numbers in the title are unnecessary and irritating. Ok, this is a pet peeve and unimportant, but still.<br/>-The ethics explored in the book, regarding slavery, bondage etc., are poorly explored and barely touched upon. In fact, the main characters are rather evil, but so are the villains in the story in a way due to the blood on their hands, but honestly I think the ""villains"" are more ethical than the MCs.<br/>-I listened to the audiobook. The narrator is so slow and cartoonish which only increased my distaste for the story.<br/>-Finally, I just <i>didn't care about any of the characters</i>. They have no depth. I just didn't care, and found myself frequently page-counting to see how long till this was over with.

The magic system is unique, with the main character being effectively a necromancer bard, with a subclass in mage. Sex is mentioned only once, where the MC considers it an irritating distraction at best from her quest (why is this so uncommon?), and romance is tasteful and takes a backseat to the story - as it should when you're trying to save a nation or two.<br/><br/>The story is exciting, the world is fascinating and unique, the only flaw is a lack of variety in race and sexualities.<br/><br/>I still highly recommend this cornerstone of YA fantasy, and look forward to reading the rest in this series.

I don't feel there was a need for so much of the story to be placed into a single tome. <br/><br/>The novelty in this book is lackluster. It's effectively a pre-then-post-apocalyptic tale of humanity, with zombies, who are actually kind of alive but kind of a swarm-like race, and have some kind of psychic link to the half-zombie-half-humans but also some humans, for some reason. The psychic elements are all rather hand-wavy and feel harshly fantasy in what is otherwise a storyline steeped in ""has science gone too far?"", except it's the military's fault, kind of. <br/><br/>I decided to read this because I really enjoy post-apocalyptic tales. I think they reflect what the author deems worth saving in humanity, which is beautiful. However, in this book, I feel that the author was too focused on considering how to mingle the various characters across time and space, and on their survival, rather than focusing on their reasons to survive (other than a couple of babies, which I understand is important, but tell us more reasons why humanity is worth saving other than reproduction and survival: ethics, philosophy, art, music, deep connections that aren't just for breeding.<br/><br/>This book, I would normally say, is worth reading. But, I read a fair bit, so I don't mind reading a book of this length for a 3/5 rating. But I imagine if I read 2-3 books a year and picked this up I'd be pretty disappointed, and I think that could be fixed merely by cutting this into 3 distinct novels. <br/><br/>In conclusion: it's well written overall, main concepts are not very novel and a bit hand-wavy, the characters are multi-dimensional but I never cared much about them throughout, and I feel this book misses the mark in the post-apocalyptic genre.

His meditations are a must read for any budding stoic - or any opposing stoicism. While technically a short read, I spent many months reading this, slowly returning to read a few entries, then mulling over them in the intervening time. <br/><br/>Much of the wisdom within this text is comprised of repeated considerations for differing settings, so it can feel like you are re-reading the previous page, sometimes. <br/><br/>I wrote five pages or so of my favourite quotes I want to reconsider over time, here are a select few:<br/><br/>BOOK 3-4: Do not waste the remainder of thy life in thoughts about others, when thou dost not refer thy thoughts to some object of common utility. For thou losest the opportunity of doing something else when thou hast such thoughts as these.<br/><br/>BOOK 3-10: Throwing away then all things, hold to these only which are few; and besides bear in mind that every man lives only this present time, which is an indivisible point, and that all the rest of his life is either past or it is uncertain. Short then is the time which every man lives, and small the nook of the earth where he lives; and short too the longest posthumous fame, and even this only continued by a succession of poor human beings, who will very soon die, and who know not even themselves, much less him who died long ago.<br/><br/>(slightly different translation of 3-10, and a great standalone quote): Brief is man's life and small the nook of the earth where he lives. <br/><br/>BOOK 5-6: ...As a horse when he has run, a dog when he has tracked the game, a bee when it has made the honey, so a man when he has done a good act, does not call out for others to come and see, but he goes on to another act, as a vine goes on to produce again the grapes in season.<br/><br/>BOOK 8-4: Consider that men will do the same things nevertheless, even though thou shouldst burst with rage.<br/><br/>BOOK 8-42: It is not fit that I should give myself pain, for I have never intentionally given pain even to another.<br/><br/>BOOK 9-16: Not in passivity, but in activity lie the evil and the good of the rational social animal, just as his virtue and his vice lie not in passivity, but in activity.",,,1,0,"2019-09-06,2020-07-14",Philosophy|13169;Non Fiction|4095;Nonfiction|1534,261203

Perhaps it once was - and my wife told me it is deemed feminist literature for it's time. Perhaps it should stay in the past, then, it truly comes off as toxic to me.<br/><br/>Admittedly; this has given me a view into the extreme difficulties women experienced in the past, and aided in my view of difficulties existing today for women. It is good to read, in the sense that Mein Kampf is good read, in order to set your moral compass into the opposite direction. <br/><br/>There is a clear lack of plot throughout this surprisingly lengthy piece. Again, my wife described this as a character study to me, and I agree - if we only study the characters through a puritan lens, on sins existing to be expunged and otherwise dull characteristics and traits.<br/><br/>I was also shocked at the chapter where Jo, a young aspiring writer, manages to sell some stories to a local publisher in New York, then confronted about it by a professor:<br/><br/>""There is a demand for whisky, but I think you and I do not care to sell it. If the respectable people knew what harm they did, they would not feel that the living was honest. They haf no right to put poison in the sugarplum, and let the small ones eat it. No, they should think a little, and sweep mud in the street before they do this thing.""<br/><br/>The only description of her writings is that they are ""sensational"". This young author should completely give up her passion and career she is successfully pursuing because she's writing sensationalist pieces? What an awful moral to this story. Ironically, the professor thinks she should give up writing because there is a lack of morality in the writing. <br/><br/>""After all, why should a woman bother writing anything other than incredibly passive aggressive Christian fan fiction, when her place otherwise is birthing like a shackled farm cow?"" - Louisa May Alcott, probably.<br/><br/>I don't think this book should be banned, removed from bookshelves in libraries or removed from school curriculums. I do think this should be read, I don't think this should be described as one of the ""best pieces of literature of our time"", as I've seen it referred to in critical reviews and advertised as such on book covers. I say this because I read this in the Audible series of ""10 Masterpieces You Have to Read Before You Die"".
